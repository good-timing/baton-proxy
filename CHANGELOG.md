## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] — 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- `sdk_version` field in emitted events was hardcoded to `"baton-proxy/0.0.1"` and never picked up version bumps. Now derived from `baton_proxy.__version__` at module load. Caught while dogfooding the 0.1.1 install — events from a `pipx`-installed proxy were reporting the stale version.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-06-12

Docs-only release to refresh the PyPI project description. No code changes.

### Changed
- README diagram now shows the full sink fan-out (`stderr:` / `file://` / Baton Console) instead of just the Console.
- Intro broadens "emits to a Baton Console" to "emits to one or more sinks", matching what `BATON_EVENT_SINK` actually accepts.
- New "Related" section links [`baton-sdk`](https://github.com/good-timing/baton) (the in-process integration alternative) and the [Baton wire-protocol spec](https://github.com/good-timing/baton/blob/main/docs/SPEC.md).
- Quick-start install line gains a one-line rationale for `pipx` vs `pip`.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-12

Initial public release on PyPI.

### Added
- Subprocess-wrap MCP proxy: wraps a stdio MCP server, intercepts the handshake, injects friction-capture tools into the upstream server's `tools/list`.
- `baton_annotate` tool: lets Claude emit a per-call annotation event when it hits friction (unprompted).
- `baton_session_report` tool: returns a vendor-shareable markdown report of the session's friction (errors, slow calls, annotations). Local-sink installs only.
- Friction event emission per real tool call (`tool_call_start` / `tool_call_end` / `tool_call_error`) carrying session id, monotonic sequence, and the upstream MCP request's `_meta` block.
- Multi-sink fan-out via `BATON_EVENT_SINK`: `stderr:`, `file://`, and `http(s)://` schemes, comma-separated. Zero-config default writes to `stderr:` + `file:///tmp/baton-proxy.jsonl`.
- Consent guard: refuses to start when an `http(s)://` sink is paired with the placeholder `BATON_CONSENT_TOKEN=local`, or when an `http(s)://` sink is configured without `BATON_API_KEY`.
- Fail-open delivery: emission runs on a background thread; Console outage never blocks the MCP pipe.
